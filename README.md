## Context
The ILVO agricultural park 'NL: onderzoekskouter' comprises all the agricultural land owned and farmed by the Flanders Research Center for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food. 
Water is one of the guiding themes in the agricultural park. In this repository we will share data, scripts and documentation on water-related research in the agricultural park and in the Rodeland landscape project by extension.
